# Python Code Sample

This sample is constructed using Visual Studio Code 1.36, so the IDE is required if you want to modify the source and running the application as Console Application. You can also use another IDE, but the project maybe need some conversion before running the sample.

### Running sample

- Make sure to change the required information in <code>app.py</code> file
- Terminal > New Terminal
- type <b><code>py app.py</code></b> and hit enter
